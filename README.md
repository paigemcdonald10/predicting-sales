# Summary

I sought to develop a time series model that accurately predicts the daily number of sales of perishable food products at grocery stores. My goal was for this model to have a lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) than the simple forecast method of just predicting with the mean value.

Predicting sales of items for any business is important because accurate predictions can aid inventory management and improve profits. Additionally, accurate predictions of perishable foods could help grocery stores minimize food waste, if they choose to stock close to predictions. 

Predicting sales and forecasting demand has long been an area of interest for data science and is often used, for example Facebook created their own forecasting model called Facebook Prophet exactly for this purpose in their company. 

Please see the final report for more information of the analysis and findings.
